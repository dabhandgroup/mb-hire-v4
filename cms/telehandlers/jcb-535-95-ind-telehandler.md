Heavy-Duty and Efficient Design
-------------------------------

The JCB 535-95 Industrial Loadall telehandler is designed to withstand immense stress during continuous heavy material rehandling applications. Its one-piece fully welded chassis maximizes strength while minimizing weight. The U-shaped boom pressing with fully welded closing plates and large overlaps provides extra strength.

‍

High Durability and Protection
------------------------------

The telehandler's hydraulic hoses are routed through the boom for maximum protection. Its side-mounted bonnet and fold-up rear lights are designed to protect the machine from site damage. To ensure long-term corrosion protection, the cabs are dipped electrophoretically before painting.

‍

Low Boom Mounting and Rigorous Testing
--------------------------------------

The boom on the JCB 535-95 telehandler is mounted low in the chassis, providing a highly rigid structure and maximum over-the-shoulder visibility. The stringent testing programme for the new Industrial Loadall range has included prolonged high-stress loading of the chassis, boom and other key components, as well as repeated transmission use over thousands of cycles.
